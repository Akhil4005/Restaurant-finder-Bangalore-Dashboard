### Project Motivation:

Being a foodie myself, I love exploring different types of cuisines and new restaurants every Saturday evening when I am free. Since Bengaluru is a very large city, with over 56,000 restaurants and new ones opening daily, I decided to filter a dataset available to me from Kaggle.

After realizing that this problem couldn't be solved dynamically with Python alone, and that I would have to code repeatedly based on my varying demands and moods, I understood that Python packages weren't sufficient to solve my problem efficiently.

To tackle this issue, I decided to use **Power BI** and create an interactive dashboard that would make this task easier. I hope this solution helps other foodies in Bengaluru as well!

### The Dataset:

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants).

*Note:* The data is a few years old (pre-COVID), and updated data needs to be fed into the dashboard for more accurate insights.
